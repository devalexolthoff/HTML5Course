#### Doing what you need to with images

1. Pick the right format
   Artwork, Logos, Clipart: SVG or PNG
   Photos: JPEG
   Animations: GIF
   Other Formats to be aware of: WebP
2. Remove metadata from pictures with  
   a phone in particular: exifremove.com
3. Resize the images (picresize.com)
4. Compressing the images (tinyjpg.com)

### Working with audio

2. Autoplay does what it says
3. Controls gives you controls
4. Height and width as well
